Before we talk about the cost, it’s important to understand what the Nooro Grounding Mat is and what it offers. The Nooro Grounding Mat is designed to help individuals “ground” themselves to the Earth's natural energy, which some believe can reduce inflammation, improve circulation, and help with the symptoms of conditions like neuropathy.

The mat is made from conductive materials that mimic the Earth’s electromagnetic field, providing you with a way to experience grounding benefits from the comfort of your home. Users simply place the mat on a flat surface and make contact with it (either by sitting or lying down), allowing their bodies to absorb the Earth’s energy. [Youtube](https://youtu.be/vfV73dxMTuE)
